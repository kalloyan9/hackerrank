In a village represented in a NxM matrix there are some houses and an empty space.
An investor wants to build a store in this village. He wants it to be maximum D - cells far away from all of the houses, so people can shop from all neighbourhoods.
Your task is to print all possible places as coordinates for that potential store.

Input: 
N, M - sizes of the matrix;
K - the number of houses, and their K coordinates in x and y; // (x, y) - as ordered pair
D - the max distance in cells from all of the houses;

Note:
Directions are only "up, down, left, right", NO DIAGONALS allowed!
